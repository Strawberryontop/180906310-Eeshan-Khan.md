### This is a unique idea, which has ambitions to acheive something very necessary for our country. Effieiency of any organisation,
### can also be linked to the cleanliness of its surroundings.Making our nation clean wont be a very big task, if we all do our bit.
### The government only needs to enable us. And to do so, it also needs open source devs like ourselves.

### The _initiative_ has endeavoured to include public as much as possible. Eg: The incentive of Rs12000/- to every BPL family to construct a toilet.
Swachh Sarvekshan, commissioned by Ministry of Urban Development and carried out by Quality Council of India, is an extensive sanitation survey across several hundred cities to check the progress and impact of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and to foster a spirit of competition among the cities. The performance of each city is evaluated on five parameters:

### Municipal solid waste, sweeping, collection and transportation
### Municipal solid waste, processing and disposal of solid waste
### Open defecation free/toilets
### Capacity building and eLearning
### Provision of public & community toilet seats
### Information, education and communication, and behaviour change.
